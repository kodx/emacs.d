Installing Geiser.
------------------

Geiser is usable from its source tree, with no configuration
whatsoever, or can be installed from ELPA with `M-x install-package'
is Marmalade is in your list of archives.  You can also (byte) compile
and install it with the usual configure/make/make install dance.

* From ELPA

Add Marmalade to your `package-archives' list:

  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
    '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
  (package-initialize)

and run `M-x install-package RET geiser`.  You can also use
http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/geiser/packages as a repo,
or download directly the package from there and use M-x
package-install-file.

* In place
    - Extract the tarball or clone the git repository anywhere in your
      file system. Let's call that place <path-to-geiser>.
    - In your .emacs:

      (load-file "<path-to-geiser>/elisp/geiser.el")

* Byte-compiled
    - Create a build directory, `build', say:
      $ cd <path-to-geiser>
      $ mkdir build; cd build
    - Configure and make:
      $ ../configure && make

    Now, you can use the byte-compiled Geiser in place by adding to
    your .emacs:

    (load "<path-to-geiser>/build/elisp/geiser-load")

    or, alternatively, install it with:

    $ make install

    (you might need to get root access, depending on your installation
    directory) and, instead of the above load forms, require
    'geiser-install (not 'geiser, mind you) in your emacs
    initialization file:

    (require 'geiser-install)

    You're ready to go!

Geiser's makefile accepts also all those other standard autotools
targets that you've come to know and love and that are documented
in virtually all boilerplate INSTALL files out there.
